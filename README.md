Plastic debris has been increasingly found contaminating oceans worldwide, posing a threat to both marine
life and the surrounding animals that rely on them. This report details the preprocessing of 3 sets of data. In
this report we are merging three data sets from surveys done in Australian waters. Vessel data contains the
vessal used to collect the plastic, with information about who did it and when. Replicates contains information
about whether or not the net station was repeated, and survey data contains information about the type of
plastic collected on this explorations. All data has been sourced from https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?
